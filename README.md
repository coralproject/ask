# Ask

*Ask is no longer supported. Docs / installation may not work, install at your own risk.*

Ask was a tool that enabled editors to create embeddable calls for contributions. Editors can manage high volumes of contributions, and display the best ones in a gallery. It was developed by The Coral Project, as part of its work within the Mozilla Foundation.

Ask was designed to facilitate engagement among all readers, journalists, editors, and publishers, in order to promote user-generated content that improves the quality and relevancy of journalism within communities.
